# File System
A group project for Operating Systems Principles Fall 2020 that involved developing a file system in C based off of Linux's file management.

## Members
Russell Azucenas - Project Lead  
Henry Kang - Buffer Input/Output  
Rinay Kumar - File System Functions  

## Project Description
A custom file system that emulates that of Linux's system. Although the group member adjustments caused many issues with the workflow and project progress, we were able to complete most of the project's requirements (more info in write-up).

## What I Learned
- Taking charge and organizing a large project
- Partioning data into blocks
- Using a buffer to read/write data
- Management of file system modules
- Implementation of the inode file structure
- Debugging large code modules through isolation
